  <h2>What is this?</h2>
  <p>This page is dedicated to information about the site itself.</p>
  <h2>History</h2>
  <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161029073323/http://www.arcitea.com:80/" target="_blank">Arcitea was a guide</a> made by a user of the bodybuilding forums, Joseph Arcita I believe, as can be seen by the large amounts of links to specific threads. It was never properly advertised on the forums however, and the owner never made his own thread announcing its creation. The original creator also made a relatively popular blogspot concerning the keto diet, which is still around, <a href="https://josepharcita.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">you can find it here.</a>
  <p>The site was mentioned on the /sig/ wiki but was bascially forgotten when the site died. In August, 2018, <a href="https://newarcitea.neocities.org/" target="_blank">Arcitea Rede/sig/ned</a> was created but stopped receiving updates in October, 2018. </p>
  <p>It was a good guide though, so it is being reborn, redesigned, and reloaded.</p>
  <h2>How can I help?</h2>
  <p>My current objectives for Arcitea: Reloaded are listed in the "To Do" section of this page. If it's not in the "To Do" section, I am likely not interested in pursuing it right now.</p>
  <p>That being said, suggestions are welcome and if you can help with something please let me know via email.</p>
  <p>My email for contact or help: "mailkvltra@proton.me".</p>
  <h2>To Do</h2>
  <p>Roughly in order of importance.</p>
  <ol>
  <li>More information and updated information.</li>
  <li>More images and videos.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Update Log</h2>
  <p>Logged from latest to earliest.</p>
