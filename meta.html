  <h3>What is this?</h3>
  <p>This page is dedicated to information about the site itself.</p>
  <h32>History</h3>
  <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161029073323/http://www.arcitea.com:80/" target="_blank">Arcitea</a> was a guide originally written by a user on bodybuilding forums, Joseph Arcita. It was never properly advertised on the forums however, and the owner never made his own thread announcing its creation. The owner also made a relatively popular blog concerning the keto diet, which is still around, <a href="https://josepharcita.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">you can find it here.</a>
  <p>The site was mentioned on the /sig/ wiki but was bascially forgotten when the site died. In August, 2018, <a href="https://newarcitea.neocities.org/" target="_blank">Arcitea Rede/sig/ned</a> was created, but never completed, and stopped receiving updates in October, 2018. </p>
  <p>It was a good guide though, so it is being reborn, redesigned, and reloaded.</p>
  <p>Keep in mind this site has gone through various iterations and is a collective effort, so writing styles and references to personal life may differ depending on who wrote what section.</p>
  <h3>How can I help?</h3>
  <p>My current objectives for "Arcitea: Reloaded" are listed in the "To Do" section of this page. If it's not in the "To Do" section, I am likely not interested in pursuing it right now.</p>
  <p>That being said, suggestions are welcome and if you can help with something please let me know via email.</p>
  <p>I'm pretty new to writing HTML and using Github. If you have tips or suggestions, please reach out.</p>
