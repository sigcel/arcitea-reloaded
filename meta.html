  		<h3>What is this?</h3>
  		<p>This page is dedicated to general information about the website itself.</p>
			<p>If you want to download this website and its content, see its <a href='https://github.com/sigcel/arcitea-reloaded' target='_blank'>GitHub.</a></p>

  		<h3>History</h3>
			<p>This website was originally a singular post found on <a href='https://web.archive.org/web/20161029073323/https://www.arcitea.com:80' target='_blank'>Arcitea</a>. The website died and was revived by a /sig/ user with <a href='https://newarcitea.neocities.org' target='_blank'>Arcitea Rede/sig/ned</a>, but it has lacked updates since late 2018. The guide was originally written by a user of the bodybuilding forums, Joseph Arcita. Arcitea was never properly advertised on the forums, and was essentially forgotten when the /sig/ wiki (which mentioned the website) died. In August, 2018, <a href='https://newarcitea.neocities.org/' target='_blank'>Arcitea Rede/sig/ned</a> was created, but never completed, and stopped receiving updates in October, 2018. </p>
  		<p>Keep in mind this website has gone through various iterations and is a collective effort, so writing styles and references to personal life may differ depending on who wrote what section.</p>

				<li>More information and updated information.</li>
				<li>More images and videos.</li>
      	<li>Create a markdown mirror of the website with Rentry.</li>
