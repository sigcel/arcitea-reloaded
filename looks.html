  <h3>Appearance Matters</h3>
  <p><i>"The difference between good and bad criminals depends on how well they were dressed. It depends on what weapon they used. It depends on their posture, their voice, their plan of attack. It depends on how they carried themselves. It depends on how they carried it out. It depends on their height, their bone structure, their body fat percentage, their haircut. It depends on who their victim was. Even the very worst of criminal acts are forgiven by simply looking good. Or cool. Or interesting, in some way."</i> - Mike Ma</p>
  <h3>Why Should I Care?</h3>
  <p>The Halo effect influences every social action you take. Everyone has a subconscious appreciation of beauty and is naturally biased towards specific physical aspects of a person. For instance, in males, a square jawline is always an attractive feature. Generally, people have a cognitive bias along the lines of "that which is beautiful is also good". Studies find that when we rate people as attractive, we tend to believe that they have positive personality traits and are more intelligent. One study found that jurors were less likely to believe that attractive people were guilty of criminal behavior.</p>

  <p>We are social beings, and we like it when others perceive us in a positive light. When you look good, people think better of you.</p>
